"1. Non-petitioned delinquency figures are cases closed as successfully adjusted.

Because there is only one city-wide probation department for NYC, all the boroughs of NYC (i.e., Bronx, Brooklyn, New York, Queens, and Richmond) are included under NYC Probation Department. These counties are left blank as a result and are all totaled under NYC."

"1. In 2018, New York enacted legislation that raised the age of criminal responsibility to age 16, effective on 10/1/18, and age 17, effective on 10/1/19. These changes impact the court of jurisdiction for youths facing charges, depending on the type and severity of the alleged offense. For cases qualified to be heard in juvenile (Family) court, many proceedings involving detention or temporary orders of protection are now handled as pre-petition filings in which the youths' cases are removed to the jurisdiction of the family court but first may be successfully adjusted by the local probation department and never formally filed in Family Court. These pre-petition proceedings are not reflected in the counts above."
