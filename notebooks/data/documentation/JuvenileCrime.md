# About

Juvenile crime data was collected from Easy Access to State and County Juvenile Court Case Counts (EZACO) available from https://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/ezaco/.

The 2019 data was used where available, but 2018 data was necessary for some states. The year of the data is noted by the states below. Not all states provide their data. States are noted if they did not have data in the last five years.

# Definitions

1. ***Delinquency*** - Acts or conduct in violation of criminal law. (<a href="https://ojjdp.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh176/files/pubs/jcs96/glos.html">Source</a>)
2. ***Status*** - A status offense is a noncriminal act that is considered a law violation only because of a youthâ€™s status 
as a minor.1 Typical status offenses include truancy, running away from home, violating curfew, 
underage use of alcohol, and general ungovernability. (<a href="https://ojjdp.ojp.gov/model-programs-guide/literature-reviews/status_offenders.pdf">Source</a>)
3. ***Petitioned*** or ***Non-Petitioned*** aka ***Matter of handling*** -   A general classification of case processing within the court system. Petitioned (formally handled) cases are those that appear on the official court calendar in response to the filing of a petition, complaint, or other legal instrument requesting the court to adjudicate a youth as a delinquent, status offender, or dependent child or to waive jurisdiction and transfer a youth to criminal court for processing as a criminal offender. In non-petitioned (informally handled) cases, duly authorized court personnel, having screened the case, decide not to file a formal petition. Such personnel include judges, referees, probation officers, other officers of the court, and/or agencies statutorily designated to conduct petition screening for the juvenile court. (<a href="https://ojjdp.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh176/files/pubs/jcs96/glos.html">Source</a>) 

In the cases where data is an asterisk (*), meaning case counts were greater than 0 but less than 5, the number 2.5 was substituted.

1. In 2018, New York enacted legislation that raised the age of criminal responsibility to age 16, effective on 10/1/18, and age 17, effective on 10/1/19. These changes impact the court of jurisdiction for youths facing charges, depending on the type and severity of the alleged offense. For cases qualified to be heard in juvenile (Family) court, many proceedings involving detention or temporary orders of protection are now handled as pre-petition filings in which the youths' cases are removed to the jurisdiction of the family court but first may be successfully adjusted by the local probation department and never formally filed in Family Court. These pre-petition proceedings are not reflected in the counts above.<br>
